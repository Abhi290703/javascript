What are conditional statements ? 
It control the flow execution is called conditional statements

their are types of conditional statements:
1.If
2.if-else
3.else-if
4.nested-if

If-Else :
it is a block of code if the condition is true it executes the if statement if condition is false 
it executes the else block.

Syntax :
    if (condition){
        // block of code
    }
    else{
        // block of code
    }

else-if :
it is used to check the multiple condition until some condition has to be true

Syntax :
    if (condition){
        // block of code
    }
    else-if{
        //block of code
    }
    else-if{
        //block of code
    }
    else{
        //block of code
    }

Switch statements :
    switch statement is used execute one block of code out number of statement based on the value of 
    expression.

    important :
        1.it executes the code at which case it's satsifies that particular case will execute
        2.

    Syntax :
        switch(expression):
            case 1 :
                // block of code;
                break;
            case 2 :
                // block of code;
                break;
            case 3 :
                // block of code;
                break;
             default:
                //block of code
        
Typecasting :
    converting one data type into another data type is called Typecasting

the difference between typeconversion and typequotation

type-conversion : 
                    where user directly modifies the code is called typeconversion.
the manually which is developed is called is explict conversion.

typequotation :
                typequotation is also called has implict conversion.
                it is used by engines.

if we want to convert one type to another typee we have to use different type conversions.

their are two types of type conversions
1.implict conversion
2.explict conversion

Implict conversion : where system automatically converts the conversions.

examples :

let a = "a"+5;
console.log(a);

let b = "string" + 6;
console.log(b);

let c = 6 + true;
console.log(c);

let d = "10" - 2;
console.log(d);

these are the examples of typeconversions

explict conversions : where user have to convert the conversions

examples :

string -> Number conversion :
let abhi = number("1234") ;
console.log("abhi");

number -> string :
let str = string("1134");
console.log(str)

boolean -> number :
let bool = number(true);
console.log("bool");

number -> boolean :
let num = boolean(0);
console.log(num);

what are loops ? 
to execute a block of code multiple times until some condition has to satsified 
is called loops.

1.for
2.while
3.do while

for : when we know the exact number of iterations

syntax : 
        for(initilization;condition;increment/decrement){
            block of code
        }

flow of execution : 
1.initilization
2.condition
3.if condition is true "enters into block of code"   if false exits from the block of code
4.conditon true
5.comes to increment
6.checks condition
7.block of code

For loops : 
            block of code will executed repeatedly until some condition has to satsified.
syntax :
        for (initilization;condition;increment/decrement)
        for(let -> variable declaration)

while :

    syntax : 
            while{
                condition
            }
